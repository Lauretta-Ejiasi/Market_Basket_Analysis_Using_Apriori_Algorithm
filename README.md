# Market_Basket_Analysis_Using_Apriori_Algorithm

In this project i showcased my ability to:
- Program with Python.
- Perform data analysis using Pandas.
- Apply data transformation for rule minning
- Perform market basket analysis

This project demonstrates data analysis on Market Basket Analysis (MBA) using Apriori algorithm to generate association rules for the Market Basket Analysis dataset.

The dataset contains the items bought in a supermarket with each transaction ID. It also includes the timestamp of the transactions.

The actual python notebook (please see link below) contains an extensive report discussing the experiments conducted including investigation of the given problem based on the dataset, and interpretation and comparison of the results.

The following points were considered while analysing the data:
- Which transactions were considered for association rule mining and why.
- Description of the analysis and pre-processing performed and reason why these processes are required (e.g., itâ€™s impact on the results)?
- Discussion and interpretation of the results.
- Insights generation (Insights from this analysis would be used to better inform businesses and manufacturers on the apetite of consumers of products. etc)
